# Deploying Amazon Resources by using Terraform

[Terraform AWS documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) 

Configure aws locally since supplying credentials in the terraform file means presenting your credentials. 

Find your credentials from the IAM section in AWS

```sh
aws configure
```
